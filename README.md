##Cryptocurrency Clusters
Using unsupervised machine learning models to evaluate cryptocurrencies with clustering algorithms

Raw data from CryptoCompare was processed and scaled. The features were reduced using PCA to preserve 90% of the explained variance. The dimensionality was further reduced using t-SNE on the PCA output and the results were graphed to visually assess clusters. These results were then used in cluster analysis with k-means, to identify the best number of clusters for the cryptocurrencies.
